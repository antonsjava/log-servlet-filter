# Logging servlet filter

This project just implements logging servlet filter, which logs requests and responses.

I originally had this implementation in io.github.antonsjava:web-filter. But I found some limitations 
in configuration which I'm not able to implement in original project.  

There are two main branches 

 - 2.x  - javax version
 - 3.x  - jakarta version

API is same in both branches 

 

## Maven usage

```
   <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.antonsjava</groupId>
      <artifactId>log-servlet-filter</artifactId>
      <version>LASTVERSION</version>
   </dependency>
```
You can find LASTVERSION [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.antonsjava/log-servlet-filter)
